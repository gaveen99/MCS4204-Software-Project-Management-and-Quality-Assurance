Performing Integration on the Project
• Integration and execution of strategy
• Understand strategic objectives and ensure the
alignment of project objectives and results with those
of the portfolio, program, and business areas.
• Integration of processes, knowledge and people
• Guide the team to work together to focus on what is
really essential at the project level.
• Integration takes place at three levels: Process,
Cognitive and Context

Project Integration Management
• It includes the processes and activities to identify, define,
combine, unify, and coordinate the various processes and
project management activities within the Project
Management Process Groups.
• Making choices about:
• resource allocation,
• balancing competing demands,
• examining any alternative approaches,
• tailoring the processes to meet the project objectives,&
• managing the interdependencies among the Project
Management Knowledge Areas.

Project Assessment
1. Strategic assessment
• To see whether the project will fit in the strategic
planning of the whole organization

2. Technical assessment
• To determine whether it is desirable to carry out
the development and operation of the software
system

3. Economic assessment
• To decide which of the several alternative projects
has a better success rate, and a higher turnover
27

Strategic Assessment
• Used to assess whether a project fits in the longterm goal of the organization
• Evaluates individual projects against the strategic
plan or the overall business objectives
• carried out by senior management
• Programme management - Suitable when
managing a set of related projects
• Portfolio management - Suitable for strategically

to perform
• Evaluates whether the required functionality can
be achieved with current or affordable
technologies
• Considers the organizational policy on providing
technical infrastructure
• Prepares the strategic information system plan
(SISP) of the organization
• Identifies any constraints imposed by the SISP

Economic Assessment
• Considers whether the project is the best
among other options
• Prioritizes projects – can allocate resources
more effectively
• Methods
• Cost-benefit analysis -NPV and IRR
• Cash flow forecasting

34

17

9/14/2025

Cost-benefit analysis
• Net benefit = Benefits – Costs
• Costs
• Development cost – staff payments, infrastructure
• Set up cost- new infrastructure, staff recruitment and
training
• Operational cost – to operate the system after installation
• Maintenance cost – for updates or enhancements

• Benefits
• Quantified and valued – sales income
• Quantified and but not valued– decrease in # of complains
• Identified but not easily quantified – public approval of the
organization
35

Cash Flow Forecasting
• What?
• Estimation of net profit (cash flow) over
time
• Why?
• Estimated net-benefits over the estimated
costs is not sufficient
• Need detailed estimation of benefits and
costs versus time
36

18

9/14/2025

Typical product life cycle cash flow

• Not easy to estimate future cash flows accurately.
• Need to revise the forecast from time to time

37

Solutions: Cost-benefit Evaluation
Techniques
• Discounted cash flow analysis
• Net present value
• Internal Rate of Return

38

19

9/14/2025

Net present value
• Takes into account the profitability of a
project and the timing of the cash flows

Present Value = Value in year t
(1+r) t
r – discount rate expressed as a decimal value
t – number of years into the future that cash
flow occurs
39

Net present value …contd.
• Discount rate is the annual rate by which we
discount future earning
• e.g., If Discount Rate is 10% and the total
return of an investment in a year is Rs.110, the
present value of the investment is;
110/(1+(10/100))=110/1.1=100
• Ex1. If Discount Rate is 20% and the total
expected return on an investment in a year is
Rs.24,000, what would be the present value?

40

20

9/14/2025

Activity
If some investment project promises to pay
$100 per year for 3 years, at an interest rate of
5%, then what is the present value of that
project?

Issues with NPV
• Choosing an appropriate discount rate is
difficult
• Ensuring that the rankings of projects are not
sensitive to small changes in discount rate
• NPV might not be directly comparable with
earnings from other investments or the costs
of borrowing capital.

49

Internal Rate of Return
(IRR)
• A discount rate results in an NPV of zero
• Estimates the profitability of potential
investments
• Can be directly comparable with interest rates.
• Use IRR or XIRR functions in Excel
• Disadvantage –
• does not indicate the absolute size of the return
• In some cases, it is possible to find more than one rate
of return that will produce a zero NPV.

50

25

9/14/2025

•

In real life, you would find many
projects that have more cash
outflows in addition to initial cash
outflow. In such cases there may be
more than one discount rate that can
result in Zero NPV of those projects
and there may also be a case where
there is no discount rate that will
result in zero NPV. So, you can expect
strange results when you deal with
nonconventional cash flows. But NPV
does not have this problem and gives
theoretically correct decisions for
projects with non conventional cash
flows. So you should not get upset if
you come across projects with non
conventional cash flows because NPV
rule still apply and you can always go
with that.

Exercise:
1. What are the differences between NPV and
IRR?
2. If findings inform that IRR is greater than the
market rate of interest (the actual interest
rate that is paid on deposits and
investments), then should we invest?

Risk evaluation
• Identify risks and quantify their effects
• Can prepare a risk matrix
• Prepare a checklist of possible risks
• Classify risks according to their impact
(high[H], medium[M], low[L])
• Classify risks according to their likelihood
(high[H], medium[M], low[L], exceedingly
unlikely[─])
56

28

9/14/2025

Risk and NPV
• A risk is an uncertainty attached to the future
cash flows.
• NPV  present value of a rupee one year later
is definitely less than one rupee.
• NPV with risk  A safe rupee is worthier than
a risky one.
• There is risk associated with future cash flows.
• High risk  use a high discount rate to
calculate NPV

Develop Project Charter
• Projects are initiated by an entity external to the
project such as a sponsor, program or project
management office (PMO) staff person.
• A project manager is identified and assigned prior to
the start of planning.
• Project Charter is the process of developing a
document that formally authorizes the existence of a
project and provides the project manager with the
authority to apply organizational resources to project
activities.

Develop Project Charter contd.
• It’s like a partnership between the performing
organization and the requesting organization.
• The Project Charter is authorized by a sponsor, not
the project manager, but he is preferred to be
participated in developing it.
• The project charter should be authored by the
sponsoring entity (product owner).
• The approval of the project charter formally initiates
the project.

• Identifies the project scope and deliverables
• Identifies financial and other resource
requirements
• Identifies the stakeholders and defines their
