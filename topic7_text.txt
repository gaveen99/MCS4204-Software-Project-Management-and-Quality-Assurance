Project Communication
• It is the exchange of project-specific information with the
emphasis on creating understanding between the sender and
the receiver.
• Effective communication is important for the success of a
project.
• Timely and accurate information should be provided to all
stakeholders.
• Project information might need to be prepared in a variety of
ways.
• Team members need to receive feedback from the stakeholders.
• For some members, soft skills are needed just as much or even
more than technical skills.

within the organization.
• External - Focus on external stakeholders such as
customers, vendors, other projects and organizations,

project team and its stakeholders using flexible and
often informal means.

Managing Communication
Getting project information to the right people at the
right time and in a useful format.
1. Use technology to enhance information creation
and distribution
• Project Management System or via e-mail, instant
messaging, websites, telephones, cell phones,
texting, and other technologies to communicate
2. Select the appropriate communication methods and
media
3. Report performance
23

Selecting the Appropriate Communication
Methods and Media
1. Interactive communication: Two or more people interact to
exchange information via meetings, phone calls, or video-conf.
This is the most effective way to ensure common
understanding.
2. Push communication: Information is sent or pushed to
recipients without their request via reports, e-mails, faxes,
voice mails, and other means. It ensures that the information is
distributed but does not ensure that it was received or
understood.
3. Pull communication: Information is sent to recipients at their
request via websites, bulletin boards, e-learning, knowledge
repositories like blogs and wikis, and other means.

the entire project life cycle.
• INPUTS: Project management plan, Project
communication plan, Issue logs, Work performance
data, and Organizational process assets.
• TECHNIQUES AND TOOLS: various reporting systems,
expert judgment, and meetings
• OUTPUT: Update project communication plan, work
performance information, change requests, project

Suggestions for Improving Project
Communications
• Develop Better Communication Skills
• Communication skills training, including role-playing
activities to learn concepts such as building rapport,

building and reinforcing expectations, roles, relationships,
and commitment to the project. But a poorly run meeting
can have a detrimental effect on a project.

• Use e-Mail, Instant Messaging, Texting, Kanban
Boards, and Collaborative Tools Effectively
