Project Procurement Management
• Defines the processes necessary to purchase or acquire
products, services, or results needed from outside the project
team.
• Includes management and control processes required to
develop and administer agreements.
• Significant legal obligations and penalties can be tied to the
procurement process.
• PM must involve in the creation of the agreements. But he/she
may not have the authority to sign the agreement.
• PM does not have to be a trained expert in procurement
management laws and regulations but should be familiar enough
with the procurement process to make intelligent decisions
regarding contracts and contractual relationships.

Buyer & Seller /
Product Owner & Contractor
• The seller may be identified as a
contractor, vendor, service provider
or supplier. During the contract life
cycle, the seller may be viewed,
• first as a bidder
• next, as the selected source
• Buyer may be
• finally, as the contracted supplier
• a service requestor
or vendor
• the acquiring organization
• the purchaser
• the final product owner

one of two broad families:
1. Fixed-price
2. Cost-reimbursable
3. Hybrid type: Time and Materials contract

Fixed-Price Contracts
• involves setting a fixed total price for a defined product,
service, or result to be provided.
• should be used when the requirements are well defined
and no significant changes to the scope are expected.
• Types of fixed-price contracts include:
1. Firm fixed price (FFP)
2. Fixed price incentive fee (FPIF)
3. Fixed price with economic price adjustments
(FPEPA)

Firm Fixed Price (FFP):
• The price for goods is set at the outset and
not subject to change unless the scope of
work changes.
• The most commonly used type
• It is favored by most buying organizations

Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF)
• Gives the buyer and seller some flexibility
allowing for deviation from performance, with
financial incentives tied to achieving agreedupon metrics.
• Typically, such financial incentives are related to
the cost, schedule, or technical performance of
the seller.
• Under FPIF contracts, a price ceiling is set, and
all costs above the price ceiling are the
responsibility of the seller.

Fixed Price with Economic Price
Adjustments (FPEPA)
• This type is used whenever the seller’s
performance period spans a considerable
period of years, or if the payments are made
in a different currency.
• It is a fixed-price contract, but with a special
provision allowing for predefined final
adjustments to the contract price due to
changed conditions, such as inflation
changes or cost increases (or decreases) for
specific commodities.

Example: Find the final price
Target Cost = $200,000
Target Profit = $40,000
Target Price= $240,000
Ceiling Price = $270,000
Share Ratio (Buyer/Seller) = 70/30
If Actual Cost = $210,000,
Overrun = $210,000 – $200,000 = $10,000
Seller’s share of overrun (penalty) = 30% × $10,000 = $3,000
Adjusted Profit = $40,000 – $3,000 = $37,000
Final Price = Actual Cost + Adjusted Profit = $210,000 + $37,000 =
$247,000
The buyer pays $247,000 to the seller. The seller’s profit dropped from
$40,000 to $37,000 due to the overrun.
What would be the final price if Actual Cost is $190,000?

Activity 2
A fixed-price-plus-incentive-fee (FPI) contract has a target cost of
$7,000,000, a target profit of $650,000, a ceiling price of
$7,500,000, and a share ratio of 70/30. The actual cost of the
project was $6,000,000. Calculate the final fee and the final
price.
Adjusted profit=Target profit + ((Target cost-Actual Cost)*Seller ratio)
=$650,000 + (($7,000,000- $6,000,000)*30%
=$650,000 + ($1,000,000*30%)
= $650,000 + $300,000
=$950,000
Final Price=Actual cost + adjusted profit= $6,000,000 + $950,000 = $6,950,000

Activity 2
A fixed-price-plus-incentive-fee (FPI) contract has a target cost of
$7,000,000, a target profit of $650,000, a ceiling price of
$7,500,000, and a share ratio of 70/30. The actual cost of the
project was $7,200,000. Calculate the final fee and the final
price.
Adjusted profit=Target profit + ((Target cost-Actual Cost)*Seller ratio)
=$650,000 + (($7,000,000- $7,200,000)*30%
=$650,000 + (-$200,000*30%)
= $650,000 + $60,000
=$710,000
Final Price=Actual cost + adjusted profit= $7,200,000 + $710,000 = $7,910,000
This exceeds the ceiling price. Hence Final Price =7,500,000

Cost-reimbursable contracts
This category of contract involves payments (cost
reimbursements) to the seller for all legitimate actual costs
incurred for completed work, plus a fee representing seller
profit.
This type should be used if the scope of work is expected
to change significantly during the execution of the contract.
Types of contracts can include:
1. Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF)
2. Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF)
3. Cost plus award fee (CPAF)

Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)
• The seller is reimbursed for all allowable
costs for performing the contract work and
receives a fixed-fee payment calculated as
a percentage of the initial estimated
project costs.
• Fee amounts do not change unless the
project scope changes.

Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF)
• The seller is reimbursed for all allowable costs for
performing the contract work and receives a
predetermined incentive fee based on achieving
certain performance objectives as outlined in the
contract.
• If the final costs are less or greater than the original
estimated costs, then both the buyer and seller
share costs from the departures based upon a prenegotiated cost-sharing formula/ratio (e.g. 80/20 :
80 for buyer and 20 for seller).
• Final Incentive Fee = ((Target cost – Actual Cost) *
Seller’s sharing ratio) + Target fee
24

Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF)
• The seller is reimbursed for all legitimate
costs, but the majority of the fee is earned
based on the satisfaction of certain broad
subjective performance criteria that are
defined and incorporated into the contract.
• The determination of fee is based solely
on the subjective determination of seller
performance by the buyer and is generally
not subject to appeals.

Time and material contracts (T&M).
• Also called time and means contracts
• A hybrid type of contractual arrangement with
aspects of both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price
contracts.
• Often used for;
• staff augmentation (hire staff for the project),
• acquisition of experts and any outside support
• when a precise statement of work cannot be
quickly prescribed.

• Example: $1k per day plus expenses or material
cost.

Source Selection Analysis Methods

37

37

Source Selection Analysis
1. Least cost
Appropriate for procurements of a standard or routine nature
where well-established practices and standards exist and a
specific and well-defined outcome is expected, and which
can be executed at different costs.
2. Qualifications only
This applies when the procurement value is relatively small,
and the time and cost of a full selection process would not
make sense. The buyer establishes a short list and selects
the bidder with the best credibility, qualifications, experience,
expertise, areas of specialization, and references.

Source Selection Analysis contd.
3. Quality-based/highest technical proposal score
The selected firm is asked to submit a proposal with both technical and
cost details and is then invited to negotiate the contract if the technical
proposal proves acceptable.
• Using this method, technical proposals are first evaluated based on the
quality of the technical solution offered.
• The seller who submitted the highest-ranked technical proposal is
selected if their financial proposal can be negotiated and accepted.

4. Quality and cost-based
The quality and cost-based method allows cost to be included as a
factor in the seller selection process.
When risk and/or uncertainty are greater for the project, quality
should be a key element when compared to cost.
39

Source Selection Analysis contd.
5. Sole source
• The buyer asks a specific seller to prepare technical and
financial proposals, which are then negotiated. Since there is
no competition, this method is acceptable only when properly
justified and should be viewed as an exception.

6. Fixed budget
• Appropriate only when the SOW (Statement of Work) is
precisely defined, no changes are anticipated, and the budget
is fixed and cannot be exceeded.
• Sellers can adapt the scope and quality of their offer to the
given budget. The buyer should ensure that the budget is
compatible with the SOW (Statement of Work) and that the
seller will be able to perform the tasks within the budget.

Data Analysis
Performance Reviews
•

•

Performance reviews for contracts measure, compare and analyze
quality, resource schedule, and cost performance against the
agreement.
This includes identifying work packages that are ahead or behind
schedule, over or under budget, or have resource or quality issues.

Earned Value Analysis (EVA)
•

Schedule and cost variances, along with schedule and cost
performance indexes, are calculated to determine the degree of
variance from the target.

Trend Analysis
•

To forecast estimate at completion (EAC) for cost performance to
see if performance is improving or deteriorating.
