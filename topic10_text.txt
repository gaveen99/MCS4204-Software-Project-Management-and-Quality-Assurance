What is a risk?
• An uncertain event or condition that can cause a
threat or opportunity to the project.
• An unforeseen event that can impact the project’s
cost, schedule, or quality.
• Relates to the future
• Measured in terms of probability of occurrence
(high-low) and consequences (loss: high-low)
• Involves cause and effect
• Risk Categories
- Known/Predictable/Unpredictable
3

Risk Management (RM)
• An attempt to minimize the chances of failure or take
the opportunity caused by unplanned events/risks.
• Aim to identify, quantify and take actions to minimize
the effect of negative risks or face the positive risks
• Risk management involves additional cost
• RM is cost effective only if the cost of RM is considerably
less than the loss incurred

• It’s not easy to measure the total cost of RM
• Involves two key components:
• risk assessment and
• risk control

11

2. Risk Identification
• Two main approaches;
1. Checklist
• Lists a set of risks that have been found more
likely to occur and
• Suggests countermeasures for each risk
2. Brainstorming
• Representatives of the main stakeholders
discuss and identify the problems that might
occur

• Can do a SWOT analysis

4. Risk Assessment: Quantitative methods
• Risk Exposure: Expected Value of the loss for
the risk
Risk Exposure = Risk Likelihood x Risk Impact
RE(R) = Prob(R) x Loss(R)
• Risk Likelihood: The probability of a risk.
• Risk Impact: The total loss incurred if the risk happens.

Risk Assessment Contd.…
• E.g.
A project depends on a data center which is vulnerable
to fire. It is estimated that there is a 1 in 1000 chance
fire actually happening. If a fire occurred a new
computer configuration could be established for
Rs.500,000. Find the risk exposure.
RE(R) = Prob(R) x Loss(R)
RE=1/1000 x 500,000 =Rs.500
This is the minimum sum an insurance company
would require as a premium.

10/11/2025

Prioritizing Risks

28

Prioritizing Risks: Factors to be considered
• Reducing risk exposure by reducing Likelihood
and Impact
• Confidence in risk assessment
• Some risk assessments are very poor

• Compound risks
• Some risks depend on others

• The number of similar risks

29

11

10/11/2025

5. Plan Risk Responses
How to deal with risks?
• Risk Acceptance (Tolerate)
• Approval of operations under exposure to the risk,
according to the organizations policies and criteria
for risk acceptance
• Should also involve provision for recovery under
business continuity management

• Risk Avoidance (Terminate)
• Changing of re-engineering the business process
• Terminate the activity giving rise to risk
30

Risk Planning …contd.
• Risk Reduction (Treat)
• Application of security controls
• Treat risk with appropriate control measures and
mechanisms

• Risk Transfer
• Transfer the risk to another party
• Insurance or outsourcing

31

12

10/11/2025

6. Implement the Risk Response Plan
1. Execute the risk response plan to manage the
project risks.
2. Track all risks in the risk register.
3. Integrate the risk response plan into the
project management plan and schedules.
4. Implement a method to monitor, control, and
track the risk response plan.
5. Include a mechanism for addressing the risk
response plan when intended results are not
achieved.
32

Maintaining the Risk Register
• Refer to the project plan
and record the most
threatening risks in a risk
register.
• After starting the project, all
emerging risks need to be
added.
• Review and amend the
register at regular intervals.
• Close the entry once the
relevant risky activities are
completed.
33

13

10/11/2025

7. Monitor Risks
The process of monitoring the implementation of risk response
plans, tracking identified risks, identifying and analyzing new
risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the
project.

34

Deciding Risk Reduction Action
• Some risks can be avoided or reduced
immediately
• For others decide based on;
• Cost vs. Benefits
• Risk Reduction Leverage (RRL)

RE before – RE after
RRL = ----------------------------------Risk Reduction Cost

Evaluate the effects of uncertainty
• Techniques to take account of the
uncertainties in the duration of activities
within a project
• PERT (Program Evaluation Review Technique)
• Monte Carlo /Probability simulation
• Critical Chain Management

40

10/11/2025

Using PERT
• Most likely time (m)
• Optimistic time (a)
• Pessimistic time (b)
• (Single) Expected Duration (te)

te = (a + 4m + b)/6

• Activity Standard Deviation (s)
s = (b – a)/6
s  (b-a) is used to rank the measure of
degree of uncertainty or risk of activity

Using expected duration
• Used to carry out forward pass through a network
• Uses the same method as CPM technique
• Calculated event dates are the dates by which we expect to
achieve those events

Probability of meeting/missing targets
• The entire project as well as events may have target
dates. Also, certain tasks may have to be completed
by a target date
• Three step method of calculating the probability of
meeting/missing the target.
1. Calculate the standard deviation for each event
2. Calculate the z value for each event having a T
3. Convert the z values into probabilities

44

18

10/11/2025

Calculating z value
• Calculated for each node that has a target
date
• Equivalent to the number of standard
deviations between node’s expected and
target dates

z = (T target – T expected) / s
e.g., Z value for event 6 is;
Z = (15-13.5)/1.22 = 1.23
45

Exercise 2
• Calculate the z values for each of the events 4
and 5.
