## Topics 1-3: Key Concepts for MCQ Test

### **TOPIC 1: INTRODUCTION TO SOFTWARE PROJECT MANAGEMENT**

#### **Project Definition & Characteristics**
- **Project**: Temporary endeavor to create unique product, service, or result
- **Key Characteristics**: Temporary, unique, specific objectives, defined scope & resources
- **Termination**: When objectives achieved OR cannot be met OR need no longer exists

#### **Software Projects vs Other Projects**
- **Invisibility**: Software products not physically visible
- **Conformity**: Interact with changing human clients vs stable physical materials  
- **Complexity**: More complex due to multiple factors
- **Flexibility**: Software easily changed, subject to frequent modifications

#### **Project Classifications**
- **Objective-based**: Specific goal (e.g., voting system for sportsman selection)
- **Product-based**: Create specific product (e.g., payroll system)
- **Compulsory**: Users must use (e.g., payroll system)
- **Voluntary**: Users choose to use (e.g., food ordering system)
- **Information Systems**: Enable office processes (e.g., stock control)
- **Embedded Systems**: Control machines (e.g., air conditioning control)

#### **Project Management Activities**
1. Planning, 2. Organizing, 3. Directing, 4. Monitoring, 5. Controlling, 6. Innovating, 7. Representing

#### **Project Constraints**
- **Major**: Scope, Cost, Time, Quality, Resources, Risks

#### **Project Methodologies**
- **Waterfall**: Best when scope, budget, time known
- **Scrum**: Iterative, incremental approach
- **Kanban**: Continuous improvement focus
- **Scrumban**: Combines Kanban practices on Scrum framework

### **TOPIC 2: PROJECT INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT**

#### **7 Integration Management Processes**
1. **Develop Project Charter**
2. **Develop Project Management Plan**
3. **Direct and Manage Project Work**
4. **Manage Project Knowledge**
5. **Monitor and Control Project Work**
6. **Perform Integrated Change Control**
7. **Close Project or Phase**

#### **Project Initiation**
- **Purpose**: Align stakeholder expectations, obtain authorization
- **Key Activities**: Needs assessment, business case, feasibility study

#### **Assessment Types**
- **Strategic**: Fits organizational long-term goals
- **Technical**: Can functionality be achieved with available technology
- **Economic**: Best option among alternatives (cost-benefit analysis)

#### **Financial Calculations**
- **NPV**: Present Value = Value in year t / (1+r)^t
- **IRR**: Discount rate resulting in NPV of zero
- **Payback Period**: Time to break even
- **Example**: If discount rate 10%, $1,100 return → PV = $1,000

#### **Key Documents**
- **Business Case**: Justifies project startup, provides cost-benefit analysis
- **Feasibility Study**: Documents potential solutions, determines likelihood of success
- **Project Charter**: Formally authorizes project, gives PM authority

### **TOPIC 3: PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT**

#### **6 Scope Management Processes**
1. **Plan Scope Management**
2. **Collect Requirements**
3. **Define Scope**
4. **Create WBS**
5. **Validate Scope**
6. **Control Scope**

#### **Key Tools & Techniques**
- **Affinity Diagram**: Organizes ideas into natural relationships
- **Context Diagram**: Shows system interactions with external entities
- **Requirements Traceability Matrix**: Tracks requirements through lifecycle

#### **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**
- **Definition**: Subdivision of deliverables into manageable components
- **Creation Steps**: Identify deliverables → Structure → Decompose → Assign codes → Verify
- **Types**:
  - **Activity-based**: Focus on tasks/activities
  - **Product-based (PBS)**: Focus on what will be produced
  - **Hybrid**: Combines both products and activities

#### **Scope Baseline**
- Includes: Project Statement + WBS + WBS Dictionary

#### **Key Processes**
- **Validate Scope**: Formalizing acceptance of completed deliverables
- **Control Scope**: Monitor status and manage changes to scope baseline

### **CRITICAL DEFINITIONS TO MEMORIZE**

1. **Project**: Temporary endeavor for unique result
2. **Portfolio**: Projects/programs managed for strategic objectives
3. **Program**: Related projects managed for collective benefits
4. **WBS**: Subdivision of deliverables into manageable components
5. **NPV**: Profitability considering timing of cash flows
6. **IRR**: Discount rate resulting in zero NPV
7. **Project Charter**: Document formally authorizing project
8. **Scope Baseline**: Project statement + WBS + WBS dictionary
9. **PMO**: Project Management Office - handles admin, resources, monitoring
10. **Feasibility Study**: Exercise documenting potential solutions

### **FORMULAS TO REMEMBER**

- **Present Value**: PV = Future Value / (1 + discount rate)^years
- **Payback Period**: Add cash flows until initial investment recovered
- **NPV**: Sum of all discounted cash flows
- **ROI**: (Average annual profit / Investment) × 100

### **EXAM STRATEGY**
- Read questions carefully
- Eliminate wrong answers
- Look for keywords
- Time management: ~1.5 minutes per question
- Focus on definitions and processes
