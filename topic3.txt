What is Scope Management
• Processes to ensure that the project includes all the
work required, and only the work required, to
complete the project successfully.
• Primarily concerned with defining and controlling what is
and is not included in the project.
• Project Scope Management processes are:
• Plan Scope Management
• Collect Requirements
• Define Scope
• Create WBS
• Validate Scope
• Control Scope

1.Plan Scope Management

Organization’s culture, marketplace conditions, Personnel administration & infrastructure
Policies and procedures, and Historical information and lessons learned repositories

• Process of documenting how the project and product scope
will be defined, validated, and controlled.
• Provides guidance and direction on how the scope will be
managed throughout the project.
• This is performed once or at predefined points in the project.

4. Create WBS

• The process of subdividing project deliverables and project
work into smaller, more manageable components.
• Provides a framework of what has to be delivered.
• This is performed once or at predefined points in the project

Creating a WBS
1. Identifying and analyzing the deliverables and
related work,
2. Structuring and organizing the WBS,
3. Decomposing the upper WBS levels into lowerlevel detailed components,
4. Developing and assigning identification codes to
the WBS components, and
5. Verifying that the degree of decomposition of the
deliverables is appropriate.

Identifying activities
• Activity-based approach
• Conduct a brainstorming session or analyse similar
past projects and prepare a WBS

• Product-based approach
• Produce a Product Break-down Structure (PBS)
and a Product Flow Diagram (PFD)

• Hybrid approach
• Introduce additional levels structuring both
products and activities

Activity-based Work Breakdown Structure
• Identify the main
(high-level) tasks
• Break them into lowerlevel tasks
• Consider which
activities need to be
completed before
others can start

15

PBS
• Product is a result of an activity
Component

Do not identify activities as products
Use standards
Products at the bottom should be documented by product
descriptions
