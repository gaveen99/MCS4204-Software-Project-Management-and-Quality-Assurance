and product quality requirements in order to meet
stakeholders’ objectives.
• Supports continuous process improvement activities.
• is concerned with ensuring that the s/w;
• meets the needs of the users
• will perform efficiently and reliably
• will be delivered on time and within the budget

• Formalizing quality management is especially important for
large or long-lifetime projects

Organizational-Level and Project-Level QM
Organizational-Level
• Establish a framework of organisational processes and standards
that will lead to high-quality software.
• Define the software development process to be used and standards
that should be applied to the software and related documentation
(e.g. SRS, SDS and code).
Project-Level
• Prepare a quality plan (quality goals, processes and standards) for the
project.
• Apply the quality processes
• check whether the planned processes have been followed, and
• Ensure that the project outputs meet the defined project standards.

Project Quality Management
1. Plan Quality Management—identify the quality
requirements.
2. Manage/Assure Quality—Introduce quality
assurance processes, procedures and standards.
Manage the quality processes by preparing tests
and evaluation instruments.
3. Control Quality—Verify that the quality
requirements are met. Compare the work results
with the quality requirements to ensure the
result is acceptable

Quality and Grade
• Quality (of delivered performance or result)- The degree to
which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils the requirements
and and satisfies user needs (A high-quality product has no
defects).
• Grade - A category label assigned to deliverables having the
same functional use and technical characteristics (The number
of features or scope).
• The project manager and the team are responsible for
delivering the final product at the required levels of both quality
and grade.
• Failure to meet quality requirements is always a problem. But a
low-grade product may not be a problem if it is of high quality.

Prevention and Inspection
• Prevention -keeping errors out of the process
• Inspection - keeping errors out of the hands of the
customer
• Prevention is preferred over inspection- Design quality into
deliverables
• The cost of preventing mistakes is generally much less
than the cost of correcting mistakes when they are found
by inspection or during usage.

Five levels of increasingly effective quality
management
1. Let the customer find the defects. This can lead to warranty
issues, recalls, loss of reputation, and rework costs.
2. Detect and correct the defects before the deliverables are
sent to the customer. This incurs appraisal costs and internal
failure costs.
3. Use quality assurance to examine and correct the process
itself and not just special defects.
4. Incorporate quality into the planning and designing of the
project and product.
5. Create a culture throughout the organization that is aware
and committed to quality in processes and products.

Role of Quality Management Team
• Independent team – not part of the S/W development team
• Take an objective view of the quality of the software
• Report on the software quality without being influenced by
software development issues.
• Have organisation-wide responsibility for quality
management
• Report to management above the project manager level
• Ensures that the organisational goals of quality are not
influenced by the short-term budget and schedule
considerations.

Data gathering: Benchmarking
• Involves comparing actual or planned project practices
or the project’s quality standards to those of comparable
projects.
• Aims to;
• identify best practices,
• generate ideas for improvement, and
• provide a basis for measuring performance.
• Benchmarked projects may exist within the performing
organization or outside of it. Also, it can be within the
same application area or another application area.

Cost of Quality
• Refers to the total cost of the conformance and the nonconformance work that should be done as a compensatory
effort.
• Total investment in
• preventing nonconformance to requirements,
• appraising the product or service for conformance to
requirements (evaluating, measuring, auditing, and
testing), and
• failing to meet requirements (rework) • Failure costs (Cost of Poor Quality)
• Internal costs -found by the project team
• External costs -found by the customer/client

Histogram
•

A special form of bar chart used to describe the central tendency,
dispersion, and shape of a statistical distribution.

Less severe defects - Customers may
experience mean inconvenience.
High-severity defects -may cause
system downtime and affect
customers' business

Pareto Charts
• Indicates the frequency of defects, as well as their cumulative
impact.
• Useful to find the defects to prioritize in order to observe the
greatest overall improvement.
80/20 principle: For
cumulative
total of the
sample

many events, roughly
80% of the effects
come from 20% of
the causes.

Categories
contributing to 80%
of the problems are
often referred to as
the ‘vital few’
whereas the others
are labelled the
‘useful many’ 28

Scatter diagram
• An efficient communication tool
• Can check the degree of relationship between the data in the
form of pairs.
• Find the direction (positive, negative, or no relationship)
and the degree of relationship (correlation coefficient
between +1 and -1)
E.g An analysis of program complexity
and the number of defects found:
+ve correlation: Can use program
complexity to predict defect level.
Reduce the program complexity to
reduce the chance for defects and
make programs easier to maintain

Control Chart
 A random distribution of points within the limits implies a stable process.
 identify the important causes of variation common to all the points.
 If the distribution is not random, then the process is unstable.
 Take action to understand what could be contributing to the special
causes of variation.

Manage Quality Tools and Techniques:
Quality Audit
•

•

•

A structured, independent process used to determine if project
activities comply with organizational and project policies, processes,
and procedures.
Usually conducted by a team external to the project (e.g.
Organization’s internal audit department, PMO, or by an auditor
external to the organization).
Aims to;
• Identify all good and best practices being implemented;
• Identify all nonconformity, gaps, and shortcomings;
• Share good practices introduced or implemented in similar projects
• Proactively offer assistance in a positive manner to improve the
implementation of processes to help raise team productivity
• Highlight contributions of each audit in the lessons learned
repository of the organization.

Design for Excellence (DfX)
• A set of technical guidelines that may be applied during
the design of a product for the optimization of a specific
aspect of the design.
• DfX can control or even improve the product’s final
characteristics. The X in DfX can be different aspects of
product development, such as reliability, deployment,
assembly, manufacturing, cost, service, usability, safety,
and quality.
• Using the DfX may result in cost reduction, quality
improvement, better performance, and customer
satisfaction.

Quality Control Process
• Measures the completeness, compliance, and fitness
for use of a product or service prior to user acceptance and
final delivery.
• Measures all steps, attributes, and variables used to
verify conformance or compliance to the specifications
stated during the planning stage.
• Should be performed throughout the project to formally
demonstrate with reliable data, that the sponsor’s/clients
and/or user acceptance criteria have been met.
• The level of effort to control quality and the degree of
implementation may differ between types of projects and
methodologies used to develop the software.

System requirements
• Resource requirements – specify allowable costs
• Functional requirements –specify what system do
• Non-functional/quality requirements – specify
how well the system operates
• Quality factors (internal factors that the developers
would be aware of and external factors defining the
external view of the system held by users)
• Quality in Use (e.g. effectiveness, productivity, safety
and satisfaction).
